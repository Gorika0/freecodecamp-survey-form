# FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Project

This is my first certification project from the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It is a responsive Survey Form created using only HTML5 and CSS3.

# Project Description

The Survey Form is designed to collect user feedback through various input types including:

- Text fields (name, email)
- Dropdown selection
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Textarea for additional comments

The project follows semantic HTML practices and is styled using basic responsive CSS. It focuses on form accessibility, structured layout, and a clean user interface.

#  I Learned

# Technologies Used
